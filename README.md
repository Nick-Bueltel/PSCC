# Getting Started

currently, a user cannot use the site without being approved by me as the admin through the single sign on platform that I am using on the project, This is on behalf of the client who does not want anyone to be able to access the site until he has signed off on a launch ready site. This game is his side project, and he is very particular about his IP. 

As an admin I can... 
* create a race
* create a class 
* generate a character 
* view basic stats about that character

Eventually this will be openend up to the public, but not until we have all of the features we would like to present to our users. He has also requested that instead of react, he would like the site to be built in something that he himself is more comfortable with editing and using. So after this presentation I will begin rebuilding the site on Django and using the existing databases towards that. 

# Target Audience

The target audience of this character creator is a very small and niche group. These would be people interested in playing tabletop games and are open to playing games not made by large companies.
